<h1>Mithra's Movie Recs</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies for this year</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Arcane</h3>
<p>Not a movie, but it's a series that will make you cry.<br/> Only bad thing about it is that there is not more of Arcane!</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy - Vol.3</h3>
<p>Makes you BAWL and you can't escape the choas because it's just that good.</p>

<h3>Maara</h3>
<p>Art lovers and hopeless romantics, you are in for a SATISFYING watch with this one.</p>
